# GemBoy!

In the event of an upcoming apocalypse one will surely need to hack sturdy
terminals in decrepit office buildings that somehow still run (_click_ _clickclickclick_) hundreds of years of later!

## Top-Notch Security? A whole level 3!?

No worries with GemBoy! Have yourself into that terminal as quickly as you can type out all bazillion possible passwords and start guessing. It's as easy as 1....2.....3..... - well back out....don't wanna init lockout!

## OK Fine! You can have my money (even though it's free, so in this case money wouldn't be caps....or cash....it would be my praise and adoration) But what is it!?

Well, GemBoy is a program (usually found on holodisk) that you can load to your ChipBoy (or similar) device and input all the possible passwords in.

Voila!

That easy!

## OK Seriously, intended uses:

So far no dependencies, just 

> cd gem_boy \
> ruby gem_boy \<options\> word, word1, word2
